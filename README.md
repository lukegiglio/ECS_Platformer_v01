# ECS_Platformer_v01
A very small ECS based platformer

A very small ECS (Entity Component System) based platformer
Iâ€™ve wrote this game in C++ including ECS to understand the basics of an ECS and how modern games are built using it. 
It covers more complex topics such as animations using sprites, physics system supporting rigid body, gravity, collisions etc..
